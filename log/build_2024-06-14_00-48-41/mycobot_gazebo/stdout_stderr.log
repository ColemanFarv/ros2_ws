  By not providing "Findignition-cmake2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ignition-cmake2"

  Add the installation prefix of "ignition-cmake2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ignition-cmake2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ignition-cmake2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/ignition-math6/ignition-math6-config.cmake

  but it set ignition-math6_FOUND to FALSE so package "ignition-math6" is
  considered to be NOT FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  ignition-math6 could not be found because dependency ignition-cmake2 could
  not be found.
